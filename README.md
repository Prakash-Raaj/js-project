# js-project
This is a Content Management System(CMS) where the user can log in as an admin, add a new page, and edit or delete the existing pages. Only if the user is logged in, he can manage the pages. If the user is not registered, there is a signup page for registration. 
The navigation bar is dynamic, and if the user adds any page, it gets added and displayed in the navigation bar. The page contents will be displayed if the item is clicked in the navigation bar. The contents are stored in MongoDB and retrieved from it.
The application is entirely server side using ExpressJS and EJs.
